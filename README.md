## Introduction

Understanding the microbial communities in the oral cavity is essential for uncovering their role in health and disease. This study focuses on a set of 30 Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs), all classified under the same Species Genome Bin (SGB748), with the goal of gaining deeper insights into their genomic and metagenomic characteristics.  

These MAGs were reconstructed from oral samples collected from patients who had undergone dental implant procedures. To add context to the genomic data, patient metadata, including vitals, smoking habits, and health status, was incorporated. The patients were categorized as healthy or diagnosed with mucositis or peri-implantitis. Namely, peri-implantitis is a microbe-driven inflammatory condition that affects the soft tissues around dental implants and, in severe cases, can lead to bone loss. Mucositis, on the other hand, refers to a broader inflammation of the oral mucosa with various potential causes.  

The oral microbiome is a diverse and dynamic ecosystem, home to hundreds of bacterial species, some of which play a role in inflammatory conditions affecting dental implants. This study aims to determine whether the analyzed MAGs belong to pathogenic or commensal strains. By integrating genomic data with patient metadata and existing literature, we explore potential links between microbial identity and host health. Ultimately, this work contributes to a growing effort to understand how shifts in the oral microbiome may influence disease progression.
